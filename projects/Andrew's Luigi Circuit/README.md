# Andrew's Luigi Circuit

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 
I am making a 555 Timer that will light up 10 LEDS in order. I made this board to look like Luigi and I put a hole, so that I can wear like a pin on my jacket.
-->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? 
It will cost $27.82-->


<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***  
I loved wiring this small ~81mm by ~61mm board as it was a challenge and somewhat a game to figure out how to carefully map every wire.-->
